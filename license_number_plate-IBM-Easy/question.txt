### **License Plate Validation Rules**

* **Allowed Characters:** The license plate can only contain alphanumeric characters (A-Z, 0-9). Any other characters should be treated as invalid.
* **Length Constraints:** The license plate must have between 2 and 10 characters, inclusive. If the license plate has fewer than 2 characters or more than 10 characters after processing, it should be considered invalid.
* **Uppercase Letters:** All letters must be converted to uppercase.
* **Digit Count:** The license plate must contain at least one digit. If no digit is present, the plate should be considered invalid.
* **Formatting:** The valid license plate should be formatted into groups of 2 or 3 characters separated by hyphens `-`, as follows:

---

### **Completion of the Formatting Logic**

In this IBM challenge, the formatting usually follows these specific requirements to ensure the groups are balanced:

1. **Remove existing dashes:** First, remove any existing hyphens or spaces from the input string.
2. **Grouping Strategy:** * If the total number of characters () is divisible by 3, format as 
* If there is a remainder, the **first group** can be shorter (2 characters) to ensure no single character is left alone at the end.
* **Goal:** The plate is partitioned from left to right such that every group contains 3 characters, except possibly the first group, which contains the remainder of  divided by 3 (if the remainder is 2), or the logic is adjusted to ensure groups of 2 or 3.



**Example of "rest of the question" formatting rules:**

> * If , format as `XX-XX` (not `XXX-X`).
> * If , format as `XX-XXX`.
> * If , format as `XX`.
> * If , format as `XX-XXX-XXX`.
